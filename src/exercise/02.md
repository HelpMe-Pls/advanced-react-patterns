# Layout & Compound Components

## üìù What I've learnt
- Design a component's props to [mimic the layout](https://github.com/HelpMe-Pls/advanced-react-patterns/blob/extra/src/final/TS/02.tsx) to be more declarative
- Abstracting away the state management of child components to their parent using `React.Children` and `React.cloneElement`
- Use `cloneElement` to maintain immutability between renders of child components.
- Notice ([at 1:05](https://epicreact.dev/modules/advanced-react-patterns/compound-components-extra-credit-solution-1)) when passing props to a non-functional component (DOM element)

## Background

**Layout Component:** This prop drilling stuff is one of the reasons so many people have jumped onto state manager solutions, whether it be libraries or React context:

```tsx
import '../02.styles.css'
import * as React from 'react'
import {allPokemon, PokemonDataView} from '../pokemon'
import type {PokemonData, User} from '../types'

function App() {
	const [user] = React.useState<User>({name: 'Kody', image: '/img/kody.png'})
	const [pokemonList] = React.useState<Array<PokemonData>>(() =>
		Object.values(allPokemon),
	)
	const [selectedPokemon, setSelectedPokemon] =
		React.useState<PokemonData | null>(null)

	return (
		<div
			id="app-root"
			style={{
				['--accent-color' as any]: selectedPokemon?.color ?? 'black',
			}}
		>
			<Nav
				avatar={<img src={user.image} alt={`${user.name} profile`} />}
			/>
			<div className="spacer" data-size="lg" />

			{/* These components has their props designed in a somewhat "imperative" fashion (i.e. using the <App/>'s state to set their props name, and if for some reason, someone decided to change these state's name, they'd have to update ALL of the child components that these components are referring to, which is likely prone to bugs): */}
			<Main
				pokemonList={pokemonList}
				selectedPokemon={selectedPokemon}
				setSelectedPokemon={setSelectedPokemon}
			/>
			<div className="spacer" data-size="lg" />
			<Footer user={user} />
		</div>
	)
}

function Nav({avatar}: {avatar: React.ReactElement}) {
	return (
		<nav>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="/home">Home</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="/about">About</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="/contact">Contact</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<a href="/me" title="User Settings">
				{avatar}
			</a>
		</nav>
	)
}

function Main({
	pokemonList,
	selectedPokemon,
	setSelectedPokemon,
}: {
	pokemonList: Array<PokemonData>
	selectedPokemon: PokemonData | null
	setSelectedPokemon: (pokemon: PokemonData) => void
}) {
	return (
		<main>
			<List
				pokemonList={pokemonList}
				setSelectedPokemon={setSelectedPokemon}
			/>
			<Details selectedPokemon={selectedPokemon} />
		</main>
	)
}

function List({
	pokemonList,
	setSelectedPokemon,
}: {
	pokemonList: Array<PokemonData>
	setSelectedPokemon: (pokemon: PokemonData) => void
}) {
	return (
		<div className="pokemon-list">
			<ul>
				{/* üê® render the listItems here */}
				{pokemonList.map(p => (
					<li key={p.id}>
						<PokemonListItemButton
							pokemon={p}
							onClick={() => setSelectedPokemon(p)}
						/>
					</li>
				))}
			</ul>
		</div>
	)
}

function PokemonListItemButton({
	pokemon,
	onClick,
}: {
	pokemon: PokemonData
	onClick: () => void
}) {
	return (
		<button
			className="pokemon-item"
			onClick={onClick}
			style={{['--accent-color' as any]: pokemon.color}}
			aria-label={pokemon.name}
		>
			<img src={pokemon.image} alt={pokemon.name} />
			<div className="pokemon-list-info">
				<strong>{pokemon.name}</strong>
				<small>{`(${pokemon.number})`}</small>
			</div>
		</button>
	)
}

function Details({selectedPokemon}: {selectedPokemon: PokemonData | null}) {
	return (
		<div className="pokemon-details">
			{selectedPokemon ? (
				<PokemonDataView pokemon={selectedPokemon} />
			) : (
				<div>Select a Pokemon</div>
			)}
		</div>
	)
}

function Footer({user}: {user: User}) {
	return (
		<footer>
			<p>{`Don't have a good day‚Äìhave a great day, ${user.name}`}</p>
		</footer>
	)
}

export default App
```

So the point is that by structuring things a little differently, you can keep the components that don‚Äôt care about state free of the plumming needed to make it work. If we decided we needed to manage some more state in the `<App/>` and that was needed in the bottom child then we only need to update the `<App/>`'s state for that (i.e. not having to worry about updating props along its hierarchy, which is most likely prone to bugs if we were using the "prop drilling" approach). 
When we structure our components to only really *deal with props it actually cares about*, then it becomes more of a **layout component**. A component responsible for laying out the react elements it accepts as props


------------------------
**Compound Component:** The Compound Components Pattern enables you to provide a set of
components that implicitly share state for a simple yet powerful declarative API
for reusable components.

Compound components are components that work together to form a complete UI. The
classic example of this is `<select>` and `<option>` in HTML:

```html
<select>
  <option value="1">Option 1</option>
  <option value="2">Option 2</option>
</select>
```

The `<select>` is the element responsible for managing the state of the UI, and
the `<option>` elements are essentially more configuration for how the select
should operate (specifically, which options are available and their values).

Let's imagine that we were going to implement this native control manually. A
naive implementation would look something like this:

```jsx
<CustomSelect
  options={[
    {value: '1', display: 'Option 1'},
    {value: '2', display: 'Option 2'},
  ]}
/>
```

This works fine, but it's less extensible/flexible than a compound components
API. For example. What if I want to supply additional attributes on the
`<option>` that's rendered, or I want the `display` to change based on whether
it's selected? We can easily add API surface area to support these use cases,
but that's just more for us to code and more for users to learn. That's where
compound components come in really handy!

**Real World Projects that use this pattern:**

- [`@reach/tabs`](https://reacttraining.com/reach-ui/tabs)
- Actually most of [Reach UI](https://reacttraining.com/reach-ui) implements
  this pattern

## Exercise

Production deploys:

- [Exercise](http://advanced-react-patterns.netlify.app/isolated/exercise/02.js)
- [Final](http://advanced-react-patterns.netlify.app/isolated/final/02.js)

Every reusable component starts out as a simple implementation for a specific
use case. It's advisable to not overcomplicate your components and try to solve
every conceivable problem that you don't yet have (and likely will never have).
But as changes come (and they almost always do), then you'll want the
implementation of your component to be flexible and changeable. Learning how to
do that is the point of much of this workshop.

This is why we're starting with a super simple `<Toggle />` component.

In this exercise we're going to make `<Toggle />` the parent of a few compound
components:

- `<ToggleOn />` renders children when the `on` state is `true`
- `<ToggleOff />` renders children when the `on` state is `false`
- `<ToggleButton />` renders the `<Switch />` with the `on` prop set to the `on`
  state and the `onClick` prop set to `toggle`.

We have a Toggle component that manages the state, and we want to render
different parts of the UI however we want. We want control over the presentation
of the UI.

ü¶â The fundamental challenge you face with an API like this is the state shared
between the components is implicit, meaning that the developer using your
component cannot actually see or interact with the state (`on`) or the
mechanisms for updating that state (`toggle`) that are being shared between the
components.

So in this exercise, we'll solve that problem by providing the compound
components with the props they need implicitly using `React.cloneElement`.

Here's a simple example of using `React.Children.map` and `React.cloneElement`:

```javascript
function Foo({children}) {
  return React.Children.map(children, (child, index) => {
    return React.cloneElement(child, {
      id: `i-am-child-${index}`,
    })
  })
}

function Bar() {
  return (
    <Foo>
      <div>I will have id "i-am-child-0"</div>
      <div>I will have id "i-am-child-1"</div>
      <div>I will have id "i-am-child-2"</div>
    </Foo>
  )
}
```

## Extra Credit

### 1. üíØ Support DOM component children

[Production deploy](http://advanced-react-patterns.netlify.app/isolated/final/02.extra-1.js)

> A DOM component is a built-in component like `<div />`, `<span />`, or
> `<blink />`. A composite component is a custom component like `<Toggle />` or
> `<App />`.

Try updating the `App` to this:

```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Toggle>
        <ToggleOn>The button is on</ToggleOn>
        <ToggleOff>The button is off</ToggleOff>
        <span>Hello</span>
        <ToggleButton />
      </Toggle>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Notice the error message in the console and try to fix it.
